title Stock cards initialisation

actor "Facility User" as u

note right of u:Not sure if stock card initialisation is done\n in a batch when a facility is created by admin\n or is done when user logs movement for a \n product for the first time.\n\n But the internal workings of stock management \n service should be the same for both cases.

actor "Admin" as a

participant "Ref Data Service" as r
participant "Stock management service" as s

a->r:Create new facility of facility type X

note right of r: Assumption: Creation of facility is not allowed \nbefore approved product list is set up
r->r: Find approved product list of facility type X

loop for each item in approved product list
r->s: POST http:\/\/domain:port/api/stock-management/stock-card
s-->r:Creation Status

end
